# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was varied. I spent time learning some basics about Regular Expressions and even more time reviewing Binary Search and Big O. I also did some planning for what the rest of this 100 day challenge will look like for me.

**Thoughts:** Algorithms and data structures are still new to me as I have only begun learning about them a 2 or 3 weeks ago. I am proud to say I understand the concepts. While I am still working at being able to churn out the syntax for both algorithms and data structures I feel good about my progress. I was intimidated about learning these but it is not as bad as I thought it was going to be so that makes me happy. The Regular Expressions are new to me as of today, but so far I think they will be very useful and I look forward to learning more.

### Day 2: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A todo list was the order of the day. I tried to keep it simple but it was a good review for using objects, event listeners, and there was some basic html and css involved. There was an issue with all the items being on the same line and I kind of broke it trying to fix that but now it is almost 1am so that will have to go on tomorrow's docket.

**Thoughts:** This was actually the best code day I have had in a while. I think this is due to getting caught up in learning more and more new things and not getting to spend more time just building for fun. It reminds me of why I love to code.

### Day 3: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Promises were on today's list of priorities. I did not make it back to the todo list but I want to finish it this week before I hit day 8 so I will have to circle right back around. I had been studying random things and although I've done promises they were in need of review before getting to any larger projects. I feel even more comfortable with them and understand how they work better than before so that's a good day.

**Thoughts:** I can definitely see why promises were needed to avoid all those nested callbacks you can run into when using asynchronus code.
