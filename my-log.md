# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was varied. I spent time learning some basics about Regular Expressions and even more time reviewing Binary Search and Big O. I also did some planning for what the rest of this 100 day challenge will look like for me.

**Thoughts:** Algorithms and data structures are still new to me as I have only begun learning about them a 2 or 3 weeks ago. I am proud to say I understand the concepts. While I am still working at being able to churn out the syntax for both algorithms and data structures I feel good about my progress. I was intimidated about learning these but it is not as bad as I thought it was going to be so that makes me happy. The Regular Expressions are new to me as of today, but so far I think they will be very useful and I look forward to learning more.
