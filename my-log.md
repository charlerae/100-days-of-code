# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was varied. I spent time learning some basics about Regular Expressions and even more time reviewing Binary Search and Big O. I also did some planning for what the rest of this 100 day challenge will look like for me.

**Thoughts:** Algorithms and data structures are still new to me as I have only begun learning about them a 2 or 3 weeks ago. I am proud to say I understand the concepts. While I am still working at being able to churn out the syntax for both algorithms and data structures I feel good about my progress. I was intimidated about learning these but it is not as bad as I thought it was going to be so that makes me happy. The Regular Expressions are new to me as of today, but so far I think they will be very useful and I look forward to learning more.

### Day 2: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A todo list was the order of the day. I tried to keep it simple but it was a good review for using objects, event listeners, and there was some basic html and css involved. There was an issue with all the items being on the same line and I kind of broke it trying to fix that but now it is almost 1am so that will have to go on tomorrow's docket.

**Thoughts:** This was actually the best code day I have had in a while. I think this is due to getting caught up in learning more and more new things and not getting to spend more time just building for fun. It reminds me of why I love to code.

### Day 3: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Promises were on today's list of priorities. I did not make it back to the todo list but I want to finish it this week before I hit day 8 so I will have to circle right back around. I had been studying random things and although I've done promises they were in need of review before getting to any larger projects. I feel even more comfortable with them and understand how they work better than before so that's a good day.

**Thoughts:** I can definitely see why promises were needed to avoid all those nested callbacks you can run into when using asynchronus code.

### Day 4: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did a more promise practice today, this time using async/await.< < A.M. / P.M. > > I started working on a trivia game using callbacks, promises, and async await. It's good practice and I am more confident using these now.

**Thoughts:** SLEEP! That is what is on my mind today. It was a busy day and I had to wake up pretty early after going to bed late so that is really all I could think about today..lol So I'm calling it early tonight, to better code tomorrow.

### Day 5: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Testing and the todo list version one occupied my time today. I was able to fix a bug in the todoList function method where in the list was not showing up in the browser -only the console. Tomorrow I can deal with the fact that it is printing the whole list every time you add an item. The testing practice was done with a programming partner through so I will have to request that code from them if they don't push it to github.

**Thoughts:** Here it is after midnight finishing up again. I find it difficult to stop working when there is so much I want to do. The thing that really pushes me to get some sleep is knowing that I won't be able to code as well if I don't have sufficient rest.

### Day 6: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made some progress on the todo list version one project but still more bugs to fix. Also worked on another todo list that was shared with me. For the latter I only wrote tests for the existing modules

**Thoughts:** I am still not getting enough sleep so I plan to rearrange my schedule to accomadate more rest. Outside of that I am just really enjoying learning so many things about the internet, computers, and so on.
